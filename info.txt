1.Loading eeglab	
2.Loading dataset
3.Event ordering: (each of the following has a parameter that can be define as True or False)
	a. erasing bad sequnces of events
	b. erasing events sequances which have too short interval between 2 and 3 events
4.Cleaning the data
	a.resample data to RESAMPLING_RATE parameter.
	b.filter data - highpass-filter/band filter.
	c.chanloc import.
	d.filter data - cleanline/lowpass-filter/band filter.
	e.aligining events to "thejump" artifact.
	f.cutting the data - 4 secs before a throw event and 0.06 secs after a throw event. 
	g.ASR - using SD_for_ASR parameter.
	h.interpulation.
	i.rereferance to avarage.
5.Create epochs - using T_start and T_end parameters for determening epochs length according to a throw event.
6.Plots for a visual check.
7.Saving results.
